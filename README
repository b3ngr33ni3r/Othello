Oh Hai...
This project is made by b3ngr33ni3r for his comp128 class.

Basically what it is, is a GUI OTHELLO GAME.

Othello being this: www.malaysiaothello.org/documents/OthelloRules.pdf

the gui uses the SFML framework: http://sfml-dev.org

Thats all... for now.

Changelog

theres an issue with the cell availability algorithm, sometimes it gets 
screwed up and directions stop working.

the flipping algorithm isn't causing anything to happen..at all.

------
TO RUN my progress so far, checkout 
https://github.com/b3ngr33ni3r/Othello/tree/master/OthelloBetter/bin/Release
but note you'll need to run the exe in an enviroment that contains all 
the files in 
https://github.com/b3ngr33ni3r/Othello/tree/master/OthelloBetter  (the 
.dll's and .ttf) otherwise it'll error out
