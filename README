Oh Hai...
This project is made by b3ngr33ni3r for his comp128 class.

Basically what it is, is a GUI OTHELLO GAME.

Othello being this: www.malaysiaothello.org/documents/OthelloRules.pdf

Changelog

MY TOP PRIORITY is fixing the availability algorithm

theres an issue with the cell availability algorithm, sometimes it gets
screwed up and directions stop working.

the flipping algorithm works in all key directions.

TO RUN my progress so far, checkout
https://github.com/b3ngr33ni3r/Othello/tree/master/OthelloBetter/bin/Release
but note you'll need to run the exe in an enviroment that contains all
the files in
https://github.com/b3ngr33ni3r/Othello/tree/master/OthelloBetter  (the
.dll's and .ttf) otherwise it'll error out
