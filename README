Oh Hai...
This project is made by b3ngr33ni3r for his comp128 class.

Basically what it is, is a GUI OTHELLO GAME.

Othello being this: www.malaysiaothello.org/documents/OthelloRules.pdf

the gui uses the SFML framework: http://sfml-dev.org

Thats all... for now.

Changelog

right now, im fixing a drawing issue with ->isavail cells so that all available
cells will be drawn, rather then lagging one behind


------
TO RUN my progress so far, checkout 
https://github.com/b3ngr33ni3r/Othello/tree/master/OthelloBetter/bin/Release
but note you'll need to run the exe in an enviroment that contains all 
the files in 
https://github.com/b3ngr33ni3r/Othello/tree/master/OthelloBetter  (the 
.dll's and .ttf) otherwise it'll error out
